WPS class to display help from any program or
REXX script without fighting with the OS/2 help
system. Use setup strings to display a help
panel.

------------------------------

I wrote this class to add real online help to
DrDialog programs. The base package doesn't give
access to the help facility so one had to use
*.inf files and the view command instead which has
some disadvantages.

Displaying help with this class is really easy.
The follwing code snippet shows, how to do it.
A DrDialog demo application is also included.
The help object which is created is a transient
object. This means it will not survive a reboot.
You may create as many help objects as necessary.

--------------

/* Display a help panel with the CWHelp class */
call RxFuncAdd 'SysLoadFuncs', 'RexxUtil', 'SysLoadFuncs'
call SysLoadFuncs

/* Check if the class is already installed. */
CALL SysQueryClassList("liste.")

alreadyInstalled='N'
DO b=1 to liste.0
   if WORD(liste.b , 1)="CWHelp" THEN DO
	alreadyInstalled='YES'
	LEAVE
   END 
END

/* Get directory with the help DLL */
PARSE SOURCE . . theSource
thePath=FILESPEC('drive',theSource)||FILESPEC('path',theSource)

/* Register class if not already done */
IF alreadyInstalled\='YES' THEN DO
	rc=SysRegisterObjectClass("CWHelp", thePath||'CWHELP.DLL')
END

/* Create a help object */
rc=SysCreateObject("CWHelp","Help Object", "<WP_DESKTOP>", "OBJECTID=<MY_HELP_OBJ>;", 'update')

/* Set the help library name */
ret=SysSetObjectData('<MY_HELP_OBJ>', 'HLPSETHELPLIBRARY='||thePath||'CWHelp.hlp')

/* Display the help panel #10 */
ret=SysSetObjectData('<MY_HELP_OBJ>', 'HLPSHOWHELPPANEL=10')

/* Destroy the help object */
ret=SysDestroyObject('<MY_HELP_OBJ>')

/* Deregister the class to clean up. You may also
   keep the class. It doesn't hurt ;-) */
IF alreadyInstalled\='YES' THEN
	rc=SysDeregisterObjectclass("CWHelp")
EXIT

--------------

Problems
--------

The help file is locked by the WPS after first
opening and therefore can't be deleted or moved.
You've to restart the WPS to unlock it.
